# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props is short for properties in React. It is a way that we can pass data from one component to another. For example, if we have a component instantiated in the main app.js file. We could give it a property of "name" and set it to value. That value could be used in the component file by using props.name .

  <Example 
    name = "sample"
  />

  props.name = "sample" in the component the props would be passed onto.

  Researched answer: Props, or properties, are  used to pass data from one component to another. More so, it allows for that data to be dynamic when being passed between components. It allows you to change data in different components without having to rewrite the code in each component.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event is a change that can be caused by user input or a click for example. When a user clicks on a certain part of the application, we might expect something to occur. This is called an onclick and is an example of a DOM event. 

  Researched answer: An event that causes a change in the DOM which is done through an event handler. The event handler is connected to a certain function in the code and an example would be an onclick, as mentioned before. The click will trigger a piece of code to run when the mouse is clicked in that component that has that onclick attribute. 



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: It is an idea of programming that focuses on objects, which have data and methods, or functions, within itself. 

  Researched answer: It is a programming paradigm that focuses in design around objects. There are four basic concepts in OOP: encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism and inheritance. It is different than functional programming in that functional programming focuses on the functions and their evaluations. 



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: The difference between a Float and an Integer is that an Integer is a whole number, while a Float is a decimal. 10 would be an Integer, while 10.5 would be a Float.

  Researched answer: They are both numerical data types with the distinction that float can be used for more precise calculations in that it includes decimals. Also, if we want a float as an output, a float must be included in the equation. 



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: It means that Ruby will return the last line of code in a method. The word "return" is not necessary to signal because of the implicit return Ruby has. 

  Researched answer: It is the return of the final statement in a method before the keyword end. Ruby returns this last statement if it is not given an explicit return which would be signaled by the keyword "return".



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: It is a variable that can be accessed outside of a method in which it is defined. 

2. PostgreSQL: It is an open source database system. It stores data for different type of applications such as web, mobile, etc. 

3. Ruby on Rails: It is a framework for web applications using the Ruby programming language. It works on the back end and can be useful to avoid repetitive, time consuming tasks.

4. ORM: Object relational mapping uses OOP to convert data

5. Active Record: It is the connection between Rails and the database, which is stored in a table. It takes the data and allows programmers to do something with it.
